[transformer VAC rating] * sqrt(2) = VDC
after diode drop: VDC - 0.7 = VDCdd
I is the total absorbed current, measured after the diode bridge  |  Hz is AC frequency  |  uF is cap value
filter cap ripple (%) = Pr = I / [(2*Hz) * uF] * 1M * (100 / VDCdd)
min. on cap ripple = VDCdd - [(VDC / 100) * Pr] = VDCcr

WALL AC FLUCTUATION (+/- 10%)
VDCcr * 0.9 = VDCmin --> this has to be >= max dropout of your regulator (e.g. 2V for lm7812)
VDCcr * 1.1 = VDCmax --> use this to calculate worst case heat

heat to be dissipated by the regulator (Vout is your wanted voltage out) = Wd = (VDCmax - Vout) * I

Rthjc (thermal resistance, Junction/Case, if you are going to use a heatsink)  |  5 k/w (or °C/w) for lm7812
Rthja (thermal resistance, Junction/Ambient, if you don't use a heatsink)  |  60 k/w (or °C/w) for lm7812

max temperature, without heatsink. room temperature Rt:
MAXjt = Rt + (Wd * Rthjc)

max temperature, with an heatsink rated Hr (in k/w or °C/w):
MAXjt = Rt + [Wd * (Rthja + Hr)]

compare these results with your regulator's max operating temperature  |  125° for lm7812
I usually use 60% to be on the safe side, so it would be ~70°C for the lm7812
