# REGULATOR HEAT
## Calculates heatsink ratings and temeperatures for voltage regulators
### in OpenOffice .ODF spreadsheet format

In this file I've put some useful calculations to design your power supply, based on the attached design, you can change the regulators of course, update the specs if you do so.

The equations take into account a full-wave diode rectifier, and assume an AC frequency of 50Hz, to calculate the worst case heat. (with 60Hz AC the temperatures might be slighly lower, but better be on the safe side)
